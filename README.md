## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a little more about the **widths/heights** of the containers in my document. The **responsive** part of the challenge is the tricky part, especially working with **relative** and **absolute** positions.
**Very satisfied** with the result.

### Continued development

This challenge made me realize that I still need to learn about responsive web design. Although I insist on following good CSS practices, I still have a hard time marking the limits of my containers.
So my focus from now on is going to be responsive design.

### Useful resources

Well, as always the Mozilla documentation helped a lot. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/min-width" target="_blank">min/max-height/width</a> page was helpful in completing the challenge.
